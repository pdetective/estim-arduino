How not to die
==============

Basically, don't run current through your heart or brain. You can do other stuff
and you might get injured, but you probably won't die. More specifically,
important points from ["electrical injury" on
wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_injury):

- Current is what kills you; voltage pushes current across resistance
- 10 *micro*amps through the heart can cause fibrillation
- Risk is lower for very low duration of current: 400mA for 10ms = 5mA for 5s
- Cardiac tissue responds in about 3ms; >333Hz requires more current to cause
  fibrillation


Ways to die with EStim
----------------------

- Use mains power with non-medical devices
- Use a power supply with no current limiting mechanism

That's about it. If you're safely isolated from mains power and aren't using
high-current step-up transformers above the waist, you're unlikely to die. Your
biggest other risks are [electrical burns and being
uncomfortable](how-not-to-hurt-yourself.md).

I also highly recommend reading [the Reddit EStim wiki on
safety](https://www.reddit.com/r/estim/wiki/index#wiki_safety).


If you think it's ok to hook cheap things to yourself
-----------------------------------------------------

[Here's how they can fail dangerously due to very minor manufacturing
defects.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hdn0MuCK_0)

Just don't do it. Devices made to be hooked to people are either not powered
from the mains, or are manufactured very carefully to avoid these types of
faults.
