Quick guide to electrical theory
================================

Other people have covered this better than I can, but some places to start:

- [Hydraulic analogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_analogy)
- [Big Clive "dangerous"
  search](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=big+clive+dangerous)

If you have an intuitive model that voltage = pressure and current = flow (and
the obvious consequences that follow), then you can probably build this project.
